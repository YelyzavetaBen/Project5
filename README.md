<h1><a href="https://github.com/YelyzavetaBen/Project5/blob/main/SARIMA%20MILK.ipynb">Forecasting Monthly Milk Production data with seasonal ARIMA</a></h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
The primary objective of this project is to accurately forecast future monthly milk production using Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models. By leveraging historical milk production data, the project aims to develop a robust predictive model 


<h2>Description</h2>
This project centers on forecasting future monthly milk production by leveraging the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model, a powerful tool for time series forecasting. Drawing on historical milk production data, the project's primary goal is to develop a reliable predictive model capable of accurately capturing and forecasting the seasonal patterns inherent in milk production.


<h2>Skills</h2>

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Advanced data visualization to represent complex relationships in the data.
- Model Development:
- Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA): The SARIMA model will be developed to model the seasonal variations in milk production. This entails identifying the appropriate orders of autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components, as well as seasonal orders (SAR, SI, SMA).
- Model Evaluation: The performance of both Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models will be rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and forecast accuracy measures. This evaluation will provide insights into the effectiveness of each modeling approach in forecasting life expectancy.
- Forecasting and Interpretation: Using the developed models, future life expectancy trends will be forecasted for the desired time horizon. These forecasts will be interpreted to provide actionable insights and recommendations for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders involved in public health initiatives.
